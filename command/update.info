 no chance of causing problems will be allowed. If you attept to update a cell that is higher risk than the
 tolerance specified, that update will fail.

    1 = medium = very safe changes are allowed which can only result in low impact outages at worst.
    2 = high = production outage may occur if you aren't sure of what you are doing, but there will be many 
      checks in place to minimize the chance of this.
    3 = very_high = production outage may occur, and there aren't a lot of safe guards in place, so you really
      need to know what you are doing and what these scripts do on a low level before attempting these commands.
